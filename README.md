Abstractâ€”Nowadays, face identification has become one of the key research regions in
computer technology.Due to this scientists share a keen interest in this area.In this paper,the
authors have proposed an application of facial recognition in attendance marking system.Doing
the task manually is a tedious one for the attendance marking system when there is a huge
classroomwithmore number of students which is time-consuming. Using this facial recognition
system avoids the issue of dummy attendance is possible,proxies and save time.In previous
facial recognition attendance systems, there were some drawbacks such as intensity of
light,head pose etc.The main research of this paper is to overcome those problems and provide
the most accurate attendance marking system.Detection of the student and marking the student
attendance while entering the school room is automatically made with this system.This paper
defines the prototype of the device and the algorithms used at each level. Algorithms such as
Viola-Jones for face detection, PCA for feature selection and SVM for classification have been
used.The proposed method gives an efficient way to control the attendance and records of students
to that of traditional attendance marking system
