In the contemporary age of computerization, various novel approaches have been
occupied the position to save labor and human intervention.In the same way, facial
recognition(FR) is one of the key areas of development in thefield of computer
science and it is the greatestwell-organized biometric method for identifying people.
Using this technique in education ground as automated face recognition attendance
marking system which is way different from traditional attendance marking system
as it is time consuming[1].Inspite of the easiest way for using the FR system in mass
manner set up, the real execution will be difficult as it requires to consider the maximum
exploration of differences that exists in brightness, face mask structures, differences
in position, copy determination, device sound, watching remoteness
etc.Numerous FR attendance systems were done with everyoneâ€™s contribution of their
strengths and weakness[2].The main aim of this research is to overcome those problems.The
modern development of machine learning and neural networks and its
applications in face recognition helps the process more accurate and efficient. The
